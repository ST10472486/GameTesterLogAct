General Overview: The the apps functionality is to allow users to log certain games they've played based on their genre, time played (in minutes) and ttheir personal rating of that particular game

Application Features:
The app features three diffrent screen each with their own respective functions.
  The splash Screen: 
  There is both a start button to allow users to begin the program and an exit button to allow users to quit the application entirely

  The Main Screen: 
  2 EditText Fields that allow users to insert their respective date of them creating a log and the time (in minutes) that they have playyed for.
  2 RadioGroups control the respective genre and and rating (up to 5) that user decides to input
  3 Regualr Button control the main functions; a btton to add all the data from the respective fields inserted by the user, a button to clear all the data input by the user and a Details button to move the user to the next screen with the Details

  View Screen: 
  2 Buttons are applied on this screen. One button to dipslay all the users inserted data onto an editText and a screen to take the user back to the previous screen if they wish to make any changes to their data or update the array

Design Considerations:
sleek simplistic design that is easily understandble to users, thematic colour scheme in reference to Xbox both as homage as well as attraction to users that are familiar with gaming

GitHub and Github Actions:This project uses Github for version control to ensure that the application runs smoothly and functions correctly through automated test running There was an attempt to compile the APK and AAB files however the Github actions.
Unfortunately was met with result of the workflow not managing to work as intened The build has been uploaded to Github for both easy access and easy updating and maintennace of the relative code

Challenges and Reflections: The relevant app both introducded me to working with classes and objects to both professionally work with layer processing and simplfiying each lines of code and avoid verbosity. Personal optimisations are within relative grounds of consideration
such as incorporation of list or pair etc. to more optimally store the relevant data as well as more try catch arguments to fix any potential errors and crashing.
